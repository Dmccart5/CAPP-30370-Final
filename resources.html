					<p>The National Collegiate Club Golf Association provides a governing body for collegiate club golf teams.
					Through the coordination and regulation of competition, the association gives non-varsity college golfers an
					opportunity to interact and compete on a regional and national level. It ensures all NCCGA leadership and student
					participants are committed to the tradition, history, and love of the game.</p>
					<p>Currently, the NCCGA has over 250 schools competing in 23 different regions accross the United States. Additionally, the NCCGA
					has partnered with multiple organizations including College Golf Pass, Cleveland, Srixon, and GolfSmith to provide students with easier
					access to golf.</p>

					<p>The Warren Golf Course at Notre Dame was designed by Ben Crenshaw and Bill Coore, arguably the greatest golf architects of the day.
					This classic links design features square tee boxes, undulating greens and thoughtfully trimmed native grasses. A public facility, Warren
					Golf Course rivals even the best private courses in the region.</p>
					<p>Since its opening in 1999, the Warren Golf Course has hosted dozens of high profile USGA, NCAA and Western Golf Association tournaments,
					including the 2010 Women's Amateur Public Links Championship. The 250 acre venue is also a Certified Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary.</p>

					<p>The USGA conducts the U.S. Open, U.S. Women's Open and U.S. Senior Open, as well as 10 national amateur championships,
					two state team championships and international matches. Together with The R&A, the USGA governs the game worldwide, jointly
					administering the Rules of Golf, Rules of Amateur Status, equipment standards, and World Amateur Golf Rankings. The USGA's
					working jurisdiction comprises the United States, its territories, and Mexico.</p>
					<p>The USGA is a global leader in the development and support of sustainable golf course management practices. It serves as a
					primary steward for the game's history, and funds an ongoing "For the Good of the Game" grants program. Additionally, the USGA's
					Course Rating and Handicap systems are used on six continents in more than 50 countries.</p>
