Web Development Final Project


PURPOSE & GOALS
---------------

The purpose of this site is to provide information about the team to prospective and current Club Golf members
as well as other interested parties, including but not limited to alumni, competitors, and the NCCGA. Up unti now, 
the Club Team only had a blog and a section on the RecSports website with contact information for our officers. With
this site, we are able to provide much more information to interested parties in a well-organized matter. We aim to 
provide a brief summary with our mission as well as our recent schedule, a bit more information on our officers, and
additional resources relating to the game of golf.


BREAKPOINTS
-----------

Breakpoints for this website are at 700px and 1000px according to the suggestions on the rubric. In the mobile version,
using mobile-first RWD, all elements are stacked. Once expanded beyond 700px wide, the header and footer remain at the
top and bottom of the screen, respectively, while the vertical navigation and club logo occupy the left quarter of the 
display and the main content occupies the right seventy-five percent of the screen with all images resizing accordingly.
Once the display becomes 1000px wide, the navigation becomes horizontal and relocates to the top of the screen. The 
main content then takes up the full width of the content area minus the margins.
